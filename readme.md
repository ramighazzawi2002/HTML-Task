# HTML Practice Project

This project contains several HTML files demonstrating different HTML elements and their usage.

## Files

1. [HTMLFORM.html](HTMLFORM.html): This file contains a basic registration form with fields for first name, last name, email, and gender. It demonstrates the use of form elements like `input` and `label`.

2. [HTMLLIST.html](HTMLLIST.html): This file contains an unordered list with nested ordered lists. It demonstrates the use of list elements like `ul`, `ol`, and `li`.

3. [HtmlTableTask.html](HtmlTableTask.html): This file contains a complex table with rowspans and colspans. It demonstrates the use of table elements like `table`, `tr`, `td`, and attributes like `rowspan` and `colspan`.

## Task

The task is to understand the usage of different HTML elements and their attributes. Each file focuses on a specific set of HTML elements:

- `HTMLFORM.html` focuses on form elements and input.
- `HTMLLIST.html` focuses on list elements and nested lists.
- `HtmlTableTask.html` focuses on table elements, rowspans, and colspans.

## Usage
